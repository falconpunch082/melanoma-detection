Logs are also available, which break down how all models made were created (including ones that did not reach production stage).

Finally, a [progress log](https://github.com/falconpunch082/skin-cancer-detection/blob/nick/HOTARU%20Model%20Creation%20Progress%20Log.docx) is available for a more detailed discussion on how the model was made.
